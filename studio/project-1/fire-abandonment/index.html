      <h1>FIRE + ABANDONMENT</h1>
      <p>
        In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings
        that we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is finishedâ€”one poem is
        abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may
        be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end.
